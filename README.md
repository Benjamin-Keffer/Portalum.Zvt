# Portalum.Payment.Zvt
ZVT standard cash register interface

This library is intended to simplify the first steps with the ZVT protocol so that you can immediately communicate with your payment terminal.
Our implementation is designed for communication via network. But it should also be possible to communicate via Serial without much effort.
